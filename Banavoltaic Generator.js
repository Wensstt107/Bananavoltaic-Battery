To address this issue, they create Argi-Worlds, planets terraformed solely for food production. \n\nYou are a former scientist on one of those Agri Worlds, enjoying the vast field of gigantic banana trees that stretches beyond the elegant terrestrial curve. \n\nBut a toxic solar storm erupted and headed toward the planet, causing a planet-wide blackout. The scrambling planetary population, now surrounded in scorched electric grids, lives in underground darkness dotted with banana-oil lanterns. \n\nWith ancient technologies in your hand and banana fields in your sight, it is now your job to light the damned planet up again.";
